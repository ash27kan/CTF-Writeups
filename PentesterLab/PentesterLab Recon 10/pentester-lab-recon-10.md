# Pentester Lab Recon 10 Automation Solution

This repository contains two automated solutions designed for reconnaissance in Pentester Labs: a semi-manual solution using Bash and a fully automated solution using Python.

## Solutions Overview

### 1. Semi-Manual Bash Script Solution

The first solution is a Bash-based script that automates part of the process of retrieving URLs with hex numbers. The process still requires a manual step to run a `wget` command in the terminal.

#### How to Use:

1. **Generate the URLs with Python**:
   This Python script generates a list of URLs with hexadecimal numbers:

   ```python
   for i in range(200):
       print("http://0x{:02x}.a.hackycorp.com/logo.png".format(i))
   ```

   To run the Python script and output the URLs to a text file:

   ```bash
   $ python3 generate_urls.py > urls.txt
   ```

2. **Download Files with Bash**:
   After generating the list of URLs, the next step is to download the files using `wget` in a Bash script.

   Run the following Bash commands:

   ```bash
   counter=1
   for url in $(cat /path/to/urls.txt); do
     wget "$url" -O "/path/to/output/directory/$counter.png"
     ((counter++))
   done
   ```

   This will loop through the URLs in `urls.txt`, download the files, and save them to the specified output directory.

### 2. Fully Automated Python Solution

The second solution is a fully automated Python script that generates the URLs and downloads the files without any manual intervention.

#### How to Use:

1. **Run the Fully Automated Python Script**:

   The Python script will:
   - Generate URLs.
   - Download the corresponding files.
   - Save them directly to the specified output directory.

   ```python
   import requests
   import os
   
   image_output = '/path/to/output/directory'
   
   def main():
       domain = create()
       opr(domain, image_output)
   
   def create():
           domain = []
           for i in range(201):
               domain.append("http://0x{:02x}.a.hackycorp.com/logo.png".format(i))
           return domain
   
   def opr(domain, image_output):
           for i in domain:
               response = requests.get(i)
               if response.status_code == 200:
                   filename = os.path.join(image_output, i.replace("/", "_"))
                   with open(filename, "wb") as file:
                       file.write(response.content)
                   print(f"Downloaded: {filename}")
               else:
                   print(f"Failed: {i} (Status {response.status_code})")
   
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```
   
   The script will handle everything automatically, including URL generation and file downloading, in one seamless process.

Final Step: Finding the Key

After downloading the images, you must analyze them to find the key. The key is written in red text within the output images. This step must be done manually.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Bash (for the semi-manual solution)
